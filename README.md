# C++ Dev Container  

This repository provides a development container (devcontainer) designed for learning C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It ensures a consistent environment for all participants of the **8AM Grind** study group.  

## Repository Overview  

- **`src/main.cpp`**: The central file for all learning and development activities.  
- **`log.md`**: A personal log file for tracking daily learning progress. It's encouraged to update this regularly with your notes, insights, and achievements.  

## Prerequisites  

Before running the devcontainer, ensure you have:  
1. **Docker** installed.  
2. The **Docker daemon** running on your system.  

## Running the Devcontainer  

To start the devcontainer, execute the following command:  

```bash
docker compose up --build
```  

This command builds and runs the container in **watch mode**, making it convenient to compile and run your programs continuously.  

## Tips for Effective Learning  

- Use the **`main.cpp`** file to experiment with code, solve problems, and practice concepts.  
- Update the **`log.md`** file daily with summaries of what youâ€™ve learned, problems you've solved, and any questions or challenges you encounter.  
- Collaborate with fellow participants to share insights and improve together.  

Happy coding and learning! ðŸš€
